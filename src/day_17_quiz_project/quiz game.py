# this will be a simple true/ false game

# a question will be asked to the use and they will select true or false
# then we will tell them if they got it right or wrong then give them a score

# first task is to create a model for a question in our quiz
# if we had a question object what kind of attributes should it have
# it might have a text attribute and it might hold an answer attribute which will be the correct answer
# these two attributes should be iniliziled

# go over to the question_model file
# create a new class called Question
# That question class should have an __init()__method which will initilize two attributes: text and answer
