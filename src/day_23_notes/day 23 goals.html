        <h2>Hey guys, welcome to Day 23 of 100 Days of Code.</h2>

<p>Now, today we're going to be building towards our second capstone project, and this is going to be a turtle crossing game.

You might've played Crossy Road. So this is a similar concept.

We have a whole bunch of cars going across a super busy multi-lane highway

and our turtle is the player who has to cross the road.

This is what the gameplay looks like. The player controls the turtle which can only go forwards, and

there's a whole bunch of randomly generated cars

which are going horizontally across the screen.</p>

<p>Now, once a player

reaches the other side of the screen, the cars speed up, but the player goes back to the starting position, ready to cross the screen again.
now at some point when the player turtle hits a car, then that is game over. It's a pretty simple game,

but it's going to test you on a lot of things that you've learned so far,

including how to great classes, how to inherit classes,

how do you use the objects created from those classes and also your knowledge of

the turtle coordinate system and the turtle game engine.

Once you are ready, head over to the next lesson where you'll find the starting

code for this project, and also you'll be able to choose your difficulty level.

So head over there and get started now.</p>
