#I've got a sentence here which is a string and your job is to count how many letters there are in each word
#and create a dictionary that looks like this.

#So your final dictionary is going to be saved as this variable called result and it's going to be printed to the console

# you might need to do some Googling to figure out how to convert a sentence into a list of words
# and use the hints if you need them.

result = sentence.split()
