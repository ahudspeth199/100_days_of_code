the goal is for you to use that data and use what you've learned about pandas
to be able to create a CSV that's called squirrel_count that has a small table

which just contains the fur color, so there's only three fur colors,

and they are logged under the primary fur color column.

And it can either basically be gray, cinnamon

which is red, or black.

There's only three possible values in that column. Now,

what you're going to do is you are going to figure out how many gray squirrels

there are in total,

how many cinnamon ones and how many black ones based on that primary fur color

column.

And then you're gonna take that data and build a new data frame from it,

and using that,

create this final CSV using pandas. Now that you know what you need to do,

have a think about the problem and see if you can complete this challenge.
